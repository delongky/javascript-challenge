For this assignment, the task was to create a table on a UFO Sightings webpage dynamically based upon a provided dataset, and to allow users to filter the table data for specific values. The imaginary company uses only Javascript, HTML, CSS & D3.js on their webpages.

### Level 1: Automatic Table & Date Search

* I used the provided html starter code file as the homepage.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appended a table to the webpage and added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.  

* I utilized a date form in the HTML document & wrote JavaScript code that listened for events & searched through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
